COUNT CARBS & TRACK ACTIVITY
Keeping count of carbohydrate intake can be a challenge, but Dario does the math for you! Simply tag which foods you ate, and Dario will automatically calculate your carbs. With time, you may even start spotting patterns between the foods you’ve eaten and your sugar results and learn how to choose foods that your body responds to better. The same goes for activity.

And Dario integrates with the Apple HeatlhKit, so your exercise, nutrition, and health data is recorded in one easy to access location. The results of this diabetes tracker may surprise you!
 
DARIO ACCURACY
Dario has been tested extensively to ensure it meets FDA guidance for accuracy, that 95% of measurements are within ±15% of a true lab-tested value. This means you can be assured that the Dario meter will provide results you can trust. Dario has also presented numerous scientific studies to the ADA, demonstrating how its system helps improve life for people with diabetes.
 
HYPO ALERT SYSTEM WITH GPS LOCATOR
Dario can be a lifesaver because when a hypo strikes, time is of the essence! Dario's hypo alert system with GPS location can help bring you peace of mind.

Your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body weight give a bigger picture of your health. Let’s read about each component in brief.

Blood Glucose Level: The amount of glucose present in your blood is your blood glucose level. Diabetes and high blood sugar level are becoming oversized issues nowadays. Over time, they can harm your body and lead to many unknown problems.

Blood Pressure: Your heart circulates blood in the body to supply it with appropriate oxygen and energy. This circulation of your blood pushes towards the side of the blood vessels. The pressure at which this process takes place is your blood pressure. High blood pressure results in extra stress on the arteries and heart, which can cause heart problems.

Body Weight: Today’s irregular lifestyle is leading to obesity in most people. Being overweight means excess fat, which can also lead to many diseases.

What are you waiting for? Analyze your health today with the help of our blood glucose tracker application and take your treatment to the next level.

A blood glucose tracker includes a diabetes tracker, which is free to use and keeps track of your data. It’s an important application for a person who needs to check their blood glucose, blood pressure level, and body weight regularly. You can now track and manage the data of:

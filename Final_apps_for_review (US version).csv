GI means Glycemic Index. It is a number associated with a particular type of food to indicate the food's effect on a person's blood glucose (blood sugar) level. The number typically ranges between 50 and 100, where 100 represents pure glucose, an equivalent amount of pure glucose.

The Glycemic Load (GL) of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's blood glucose level after eating it. It can be used to apply the Glycemic Index to dieting by connecting the GI number with carbohydrates content in a given serving. It gives an estimation on how much a serving size of food is likely to increase blood-sugar levels.

Net carbs are total carbs minus fiber which is indigestible thus it is considered not to raise blood sugar levels.

BMI is used to assess health risks and body structure but does not take in consideration muscular mass so it can sometimes be inaccurate, for instance in the case of athletes or pregnant women.

Your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and body weight give a bigger picture of your health. Let’s read about each component in brief.

Blood Glucose Level: The amount of glucose present in your blood is your blood glucose level. Diabetes and high blood sugar level are becoming oversized issues nowadays. Over time, they can harm your body and lead to many unknown problems.

Blood Pressure: Your heart circulates blood in the body to supply it with appropriate oxygen and energy. This circulation of your blood pushes towards the side of the blood vessels. The pressure at which this process takes place is your blood pressure. High blood pressure results in extra stress on the arteries and heart, which can cause heart problems.

Body Weight: Today’s irregular lifestyle is leading to obesity in most people. Being overweight means excess fat, which can also lead to many diseases.

What are you waiting for? Analyze your health today with the help of our blood glucose tracker application and take your treatment to the next level.

A blood glucose tracker includes a diabetes tracker, which is free to use and keeps track of your data. It’s an important application for a person who needs to check their blood glucose, blood pressure level, and body weight regularly. You can now track and manage the data of:

• Also comes with a weight tracker, blood pressure tracker, and estimated A1C data tracker.
• Offline mode: Record your blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight offline in the data log.
